Description: DBSverify stands for "Doublet Base Substitution verify". The
             main function is Read_DBS_VCF_and_BAMs_to_verify_DBSs. This
             reads a VCF (variant call format) file containing somatic 
             DBS mutations and examines the supporting reads in the 
             corresponding tumor and normal BAM files to assess wither 
             each DBS is likely real, i.e. arose at one time on a single
             chromosome. This is as opposed to being two adjacent single 
             base mutations on homologous chromosomes, or adjacent 
             mutations that occurred on the same chromosome but at 
             detectably different times. Many somatic mutation callers do
             not call DBSs at all, and those that do sometimes make 
             obvious errors, such as calling DBSs that consist of a 
             germline SNP next to a somatic single base mutation.
             Because of the way the functionality of this package is used,
             the main function for most users will be 
             Read_DBS_VCF_and_BAMs_to_verify_DBSs.
