Description: DBSverify stands for "Doublet Base Substitution verify". 
             The main function is ReadVCFAndBAMsAndVerifyDBS. This reads 
             a VCF (variant call format) file for somatic DBS mutations and
             and examines the supporting reads in the source tumor and
             normal BAM files to assess wither each DBS is likely real,
             i.e. arose at one time on a single chromosome. This is
             as opposed to being two adjacent single base mutations on
             homologous chromosomes, or adjacent mutations that occurred
             on the same chromosome but a different times. Many somatic
             mutation callers do call DBSs at all, and those that
             do sometime make obvious errors, such as calling DBSs that
             consist of a germline SNP next to a somatic single base 
             mutation.
