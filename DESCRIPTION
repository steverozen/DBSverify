Description: DBSverify stands for "Doublet Base Substitution verify". 
             A "Doublet Base Substitution" is the simultaneous mutation
             of adjacent bases, for example mutations from TA to GT and
             from TC to AA, which are often caused by the carcinogen 
             aristolochic acid. The main function is 
             Read_DBS_VCF_and_BAMs_to_verify_DBSs. This function
             reads a VCF (variant call format) file containing somatic 
             DBS mutations and examines the supporting reads in the 
             corresponding tumor and normal BAM files to assess whether 
             each DBS is likely real, i.e. arose at one time on a single
             chromosome. This is as opposed to being two adjacent single 
             base mutations on homologous chromosomes, or adjacent 
             mutations that occurred on the same chromosome but at 
             detectably different times. Many somatic mutation callers do
             not call DBSs at all, and those that do sometimes make 
             obvious errors, such as calling DBSs that consist of a 
             germline SNP next to a somatic single base mutation.
             The output of Read_DBS_VCF_and_BAMs_to_verify_DBSs is a new
             VCF file with an assessment of whether each DBSs is
             likely real or not.
